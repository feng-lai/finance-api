# Finance API

**Finance API** is a lightweight and efficient web-based service built using the ThinkPHP 5.1 framework. It is designed to serve as a modular backend for managing financial data, facilitating seamless integration with web or mobile clients.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of application logic and routing through ThinkPHP 5.1.
- 📊 **Data Handling**: Built-in support for API-based data exchange using JSON.
- 🛡️ **Security First**: Designed with secure access and proper input validation in mind.
- 🚀 **Performance Optimized**: Powered by PHP and optimized for fast responses.

## 🏁 Quick Start

This project is powered by [ThinkPHP 5.1](https://www.thinkphp.cn/) and supports command-line execution. Below is the entry file for bootstrapping the application:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
namespace think;

require __DIR__ . '/thinkphp/base.php';

Container::get('app')->path(__DIR__ . '/application/')->initialize();

Console::init();
```

Save the file and execute it with:

```bash
php entry.php
```

> Replace `entry.php` with your actual CLI bootstrap file.
